    <h1>The Awful German Language <span>(by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain">Mark Twain</a>)</span>
    </h1>
    <blockquote>A little learning makes the whole world kin.<br> -- <cite>Proverbs</cite> xxxii, 7.
    </blockquote>

    <p>I went often to look at the collection of curiosities in <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg_Castle">Heidelberg Castle</a>, and one day I surprised the
        keeper of it with my German. I spoke entirely in that language. He was greatly
        interested; and after I had talked a while he said my German was very rare, possibly a &quot;unique&quot;; and
        wanted to add it to his museum.
    </p>

    <p>If he had known what it had cost me to acquire my art, he would also have known that it would break any collector
        to buy it. Harris and I had been hard at work on our German during several weeks at that time, and although we
        had made good
        progress, it had been accomplished under great difficulty and annoyance, for three of our teachers had died in
        the mean time. A person who has not studied German can form no idea of what a perplexing language it is.
    </p>

    <p>Surely there is not another language that is so slipshod and systemless, and so slippery and elusive to the
        grasp. One is washed about in it, hither and thither, in the most helpless way; and when at last he thinks he
        has captured a rule which
        offers firm ground to take a rest on amid the general rage and turmoil of the ten parts of speech, he turns over
        the page and reads, &quot;Let the pupil make careful note of the following <strong lang="de">exceptions</strong>.&quot; He
        runs his
        eye down and finds that there are more exceptions to the rule than instances of it. So overboard he goes again,
        to hunt for another Ararat and find another quicksand. Such has been, and continues to be, my experience. Every
        time I think
        I have got one of these four confusing &quot;cases&quot; where I am master of it, a seemingly insignificant
        preposition intrudes itself into my sentence, clothed with an awful and unsuspected power, and crumbles the
        ground from under me.
        For instance, my book inquires after a certain bird -- (it is always inquiring after things which are of no sort
        of consequence to anybody): &quot;Where is the bird?&quot; Now the answer to this question -- according to the
        book -- is
        that the bird is waiting in the blacksmith shop on account of the rain. Of course no bird would do that, but
        then you must stick to the book. Very well, I begin to cipher out the German for that answer. I begin at the
        wrong end, necessarily,
        for that is the German idea. I say to myself, &quot;<strong lang="de">Regen</strong> (rain) is masculine -- or maybe it is
        feminine -- or possibly neuter -- it is too much trouble to look now. Therefore, it is either
        <strong lang="de">der</strong> (the) Regen,
        or <strong lang="de">die</strong> (the) Regen, or <strong lang="de">das</strong> (the) Regen, according to which gender it may turn
        out to be when I look. In the interest of science, I will cipher it out on the hypothesis that it is masculine.
        Very well --
        then
        <strong lang="de">the</strong> rain is <strong lang="de">der</strong> Regen, if it is simply in the quiescent state of being
        <strong lang="de">mentioned</strong>, without enlargement or discussion -- Nominative case; but if this rain is lying
        around, in a kind of a
        general way on the ground, it is then definitely located, it is <strong lang="de">doing something</strong> -- that is,
        <strong lang="de">resting</strong> (which is one of the German grammar's ideas of doing something), and this throws the
        rain into the Dative case, and makes it
        <strong lang="de">dem</strong> Regen. However, this rain is not resting, but is doing something
        <strong lang="de">actively</strong>, -- it is falling -- to interfere with the bird, likely -- and this indicates <strong lang="de">movement</strong>,
        which has the effect of sliding it into the Accusative case and changing <strong lang="de">dem</strong> Regen into
        <strong lang="de">den</strong> Regen.&quot; Having completed the grammatical horoscope of this matter, I answer up
        confidently and state in German that the bird is staying in the blacksmith shop &quot;wegen (on account of)
        <strong lang="de">den</strong> Regen.&quot;
        Then the teacher lets me softly down with the remark that whenever the word &quot;wegen&quot; drops into a
        sentence, it <strong lang="de">always</strong> throws that subject into the <strong lang="de">Genitive</strong> case, regardless of
        consequences --
        and that therefore this bird stayed in the blacksmith shop &quot;wegen
        <strong lang="de">des</strong> Regens.&quot;</p>

    <p>N. B. -- I was informed, later, by a higher authority, that there was an &quot;exception&quot; which permits one
        to say &quot;wegen <strong lang="de">dem</strong> Regen&quot; in certain peculiar and complex circumstances, but that this
        exception is
        not extended to anything <strong lang="de">but</strong> rain.</p>

    <p>There are ten parts of speech, and they are all troublesome. An average sentence, in a German newspaper, is a
        sublime and impressive curiosity; it occupies a quarter of a column; it contains all the ten parts of speech --
        not in regular order,
        but mixed; it is built mainly of compound words constructed by the writer on the spot, and not to be found in
        any dictionary -- six or seven words compacted into one, without joint or seam -- that is, without hyphens; it
        treats of fourteen
        or fifteen different subjects, each inclosed in a parenthesis of its own, with here and there extra parentheses
        which reinclose three or four of the minor parentheses, making pens within pens: finally, all the parentheses
        and reparentheses
        are massed together between a couple of king-parentheses, one of which is placed in the first line of the
        majestic sentence and the other in the middle of the last line of it --
        <strong lang="de">after which comes the VERB</strong>, and you find out for the first time what the man has been talking
        about; and after the verb -- merely by way of ornament, as far as I can make out -- the writer shovels in &quot;<strong lang="de">haben
            sind
            gewesen gehabt haben geworden sein</strong>,&quot; or words to that effect, and the monument is finished. I
        suppose that this closing hurrah is in the nature of the flourish to a man's signature -- not necessary, but
        pretty. German books are
        easy enough to read when you hold them before the looking-glass or stand on your head -- so as to reverse the
        construction -- but I think that to learn to read and understand a German newspaper is a thing which must always
        remain an impossibility
        to a foreigner.</p>

    <p>Yet even the German books are not entirely free from attacks of the Parenthesis distemper -- though they are
        usually so mild as to cover only a few lines, and therefore when you at last get down to the verb it carries
        some meaning to your
        mind because you are able to remember a good deal of what has gone before. Now here is a sentence from a popular
        and excellent German novel -- with a slight parenthesis in it. I will make a perfectly literal translation, and
        throw in the
        parenthesis-marks and some hyphens for the assistance of the reader -- though in the original there are no
        parenthesis-marks or hyphens, and the reader is left to flounder through to the remote verb the best way he
        can:</p>

    <p>&quot;But when he, upon the street, the
        (in-satin-and-silk-covered-now-very-unconstrained-after-the-newest-fashioned-dressed) government counselor's
        wife <strong lang="de">met</strong>,&quot; etc., etc. </p>

    <blockquote  lang="de">1. Wenn er aber auf der Strasse der in Sammt und Seide geh&uuml;llten jetzt sehr ungenirt nach der
        neusten Mode gekleideten Regierungsr&auml;thin begegnet.
    </blockquote>

    <p>That is from <cite><a href="https://archive.org/details/oldmamsellessec00marlgoog">The Old Mamselle's Secret</a></cite>,
        by Mrs. Marlitt. And that sentence is constructed upon the most approved German model. You observe how far that
        verb is
        from the reader's base of operations; well, in a German newspaper they put their verb away over on the next
        page; and I have heard that sometimes after stringing along the exciting preliminaries and parentheses for a
        column or two, they
        get in a hurry and have to go to press without getting to the verb at all. Of course, then, the reader is left
        in a very exhausted and ignorant state.</p>

    <p>We have the Parenthesis disease in our literature, too; and one may see cases of it every day in our books and
        newspapers: but with us it is the mark and sign of an unpracticed writer or a cloudy intellect, whereas with the
        Germans it is doubtless
        the mark and sign of a practiced pen and of the presence of that sort of luminous intellectual fog which stands
        for clearness among these people. For surely it is <strong lang="de">not</strong> clearness -- it necessarily can't be
        clearness. Even
        a jury would have penetration enough to discover that. A writer's ideas must be a good deal confused, a good
        deal out of line and sequence, when he starts out to say that a man met a counselor's wife in the street, and
        then right in the
        midst of this so simple undertaking halts these approaching people and makes them stand still until he jots down
        an inventory of the woman's dress. That is manifestly absurd. It reminds a person of those dentists who secure
        your instant
        and breathless interest in a tooth by taking a grip on it with the forceps, and then stand there and drawl
        through a tedious anecdote before they give the dreaded jerk. Parentheses in literature and dentistry are in bad
        taste.</p>

    <p>The Germans have another kind of parenthesis, which they make by splitting a verb in two and putting half of it
        at the beginning of an exciting chapter and the <strong lang="de">other half</strong> at the end of it. Can any one
        conceive of anything
        more confusing than that? These things are called &quot;separable verbs.&quot; The German grammar is blistered
        all over with separable verbs; and the wider the two portions of one of them are spread apart, the better the
        author of the
        crime is pleased with his performance. A favorite one is <strong lang="de">reiste ab</strong> -- which means departed.
        Here is an example which I culled from a novel and reduced to English:</p>

    <blockquote>&quot;The trunks being now ready, he <strong lang="de">DE-</strong> after kissing his mother and sisters, and once
        more pressing to his bosom his adored Gretchen, who, dressed in simple white muslin, with a single tuberose in
        the ample folds of her
        rich brown hair, had tottered feebly down the stairs, still pale from the terror and excitement of the past
        evening, but longing to lay her poor aching head yet once again upon the breast of him whom she loved more
        dearly than life itself,
        <strong lang="de">PARTED</strong>.&quot;
    </blockquote>

    <p>However, it is not well to dwell too much on the separable verbs. One is sure to lose his temper early; and if he
        sticks to the subject, and will not be warned, it will at last either soften his brain or petrify it. Personal
        pronouns and adjectives
        are a fruitful nuisance in this language, and should have been left out. For instance, the same sound, <strong lang="de">sie</strong>,
        means
        <strong lang="de">you</strong>, and it means <strong lang="de">she</strong>, and it means <strong lang="de">her</strong>, and it means
        <strong lang="de">it</strong>, and it means <strong lang="de">they</strong>, and it means <strong lang="de">them</strong>. Think of the ragged
        poverty of a language which has to make one word do the work of six -- and a poor little weak thing of only
        three letters
        at that. But mainly, think of the exasperation of never knowing which of these meanings the speaker is trying to
        convey. This explains why, whenever a person says <strong lang="de">sie</strong> to me, I generally try to kill him, if a
        stranger.</p>

    <p>Now observe the Adjective. Here was a case where simplicity would have been an advantage; therefore, for no other
        reason, the inventor of this language complicated it all he could. When we wish to speak of our &quot;good
        friend or friends,&quot;
        in our enlightened tongue, we stick to the one form and have no trouble or hard feeling about it; but with the
        German tongue it is different. When a German gets his hands on an adjective, he declines it, and keeps on
        declining it until
        the common sense is all declined out of it. It is as bad as Latin. He says, for instance:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Singular
            <ul>
                <li>Nominative -- Mein gut<strong>er</strong> Freund, my good friend.</li>
                <li>Genitives -- Mein<strong>es</strong> gut<strong>en</strong> Freund<strong>es</strong>, of my good
                    friend.
                </li>
                <li>Dative -- Mein<strong>em</strong> gut<strong>en</strong> Freund, to my good friend.</li>
                <li>Accusative -- Mein<strong>en</strong> gut<strong>en</strong> Freund, my good friend.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Plural
            <ul>
                <li>N. -- Mein<strong>e</strong> gut<strong>en</strong> Freund<strong>e</strong>, my good friends.</li>
                <li>G. -- Mein<strong>er</strong> gut<strong>en</strong> Freund<strong>e</strong>, of my good friends.
                </li>
                <li>D. -- Mein<strong>en</strong> gut<strong>en</strong> Freund<strong>en</strong>, to my good friends.
                </li>
                <li>A. -- Mein<strong>e</strong> gut<strong>en</strong> Freund<strong>e</strong>, my good friends.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now let the candidate for the asylum try to memorize those variations, and see how soon he will be elected. One
        might better go without friends in Germany than take all this trouble about them. I have shown what a bother it
        is to decline a
        good (male) friend; well this is only a third of the work, for there is a variety of new distortions of the
        adjective to be learned when the object is feminine, and still another when the object is neuter. Now there are
        more adjectives
        in this language than there are black cats in Switzerland, and they must all be as elaborately declined as the
        examples above suggested. Difficult? -- troublesome? -- these words cannot describe it. I heard a Californian
        student in Heidelberg
        say, in one of his calmest moods, that he would rather decline two drinks than one German adjective.</p>

    <p>The inventor of the language seems to have taken pleasure in complicating it in every way he could think of. For
        instance, if one is casually referring to a house, <strong lang="de">Haus</strong>, or a horse, <strong lang="de">Pferd</strong>, or
        a dog, <strong lang="de">Hund</strong>,
        he spells these words as I have indicated; but if he is referring to them in the Dative case, he sticks on a
        foolish and unnecessary <strong lang="de">e</strong> and spells them
        <strong lang="de">Hause</strong>, <strong lang="de">Pferde</strong>, <strong lang="de">Hunde</strong>. So, as an added <strong lang="de">e</strong>
        often signifies the plural, as the <strong lang="de">s</strong> does with us, the new student is likely to go on for a
        month making twins
        out of a Dative dog before he discovers his mistake; and on the other hand, many a new student who could ill
        afford loss, has bought and paid for two dogs and only got one of them, because he ignorantly bought that dog in
        the Dative singular
        when he really supposed he was talking plural -- which left the law on the seller's side, of course, by the
        strict rules of grammar, and therefore a suit for recovery could not lie.
    </p>

    <p>In German, all the Nouns begin with a capital letter. Now that is a good idea; and a good idea, in this language,
        is necessarily conspicuous from its lonesomeness. I consider this capitalizing of nouns a good idea, because by
        reason of it
        you are almost always able to tell a noun the minute you see it. You fall into error occasionally, because you
        mistake the name of a person for the name of a thing, and waste a good deal of time trying to dig a meaning out
        of it. German
        names almost always do mean something, and this helps to deceive the student. I translated a passage one day,
        which said that &quot;the infuriated tigress broke loose and utterly ate up the unfortunate fir forest&quot; (
        <strong lang="de">Tannenwald</strong>). When I was girding up my loins to doubt this, I found out that Tannenwald in this
        instance was a man's name.</p>

    <p>Every noun has a gender, and there is no sense or system in the distribution; so the gender of each must be
        learned separately and by heart. There is no other way. To do this one has to have a memory like a
        memorandum-book. In German, a young
        lady has no sex, while a turnip has. Think what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip, and what
        callous disrespect for the girl. See how it looks in print -- I translate this from a conversation in one of the
        best of the German
        Sunday-school books:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>&quot;<strong lang="de">Gretchen</strong>.</dt>
        <dd>Wilhelm, where is the turnip?</dd>
        <dt><strong lang="de">Wilhelm</strong>.</dt>
        <dd>She has gone to the kitchen.</dd>
        <dt><strong lang="de">Gretchen</strong>.</dt>
        <dd>Where is the accomplished and beautiful English maiden?
        </dd>
        <dt><strong lang="de">Wilhelm</strong>.</dt>
        <dd>It has gone to the opera.&quot;</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>To continue with the German genders: a tree is male, its buds are female, its leaves are neuter; horses are
        sexless, dogs are male, cats are female -- tomcats included, of course; a person's mouth, neck, bosom, elbows,
        fingers, nails, feet,
        and body are of the male sex, and his head is male or neuter according to the word selected to signify it, and
        <strong lang="de">not</strong> according to the sex of the individual who wears it -- for in Germany all the women either
        male heads or
        sexless ones; a person's nose, lips, shoulders, breast, hands, and toes are of the female sex; and his hair,
        ears, eyes, chin, legs, knees, heart, and conscience haven't any sex at all. The inventor of the language
        probably got what he
        knew about a conscience from hearsay.</p>

    <p>Now, by the above dissection, the reader will see that in Germany a man may
        <strong lang="de">think</strong> he is a man, but when he comes to look into the matter closely, he is bound to have his
        doubts; he finds that in sober truth he is a most ridiculous mixture; and if he ends by trying to comfort
        himself with the thought
        that he can at least depend on a third of this mess as being manly and masculine, the humiliating second thought
        will quickly remind him that in this respect he is no better off than any woman or cow in the land.</p>

    <p>In the German it is true that by some oversight of the inventor of the language, a Woman is a female; but a Wife
        (<strong lang="de">Wei√ü</strong>) is not -- which is unfortunate. A Wife, here, has no sex; she is neuter; so, according
        to the grammar,
        a fish is <strong lang="de">he</strong>, his scales are <strong lang="de">she</strong>, but a fishwife is neither. To describe a
        wife as sexless may be called under-description; that is bad enough, but over-description is surely worse. A
        German speaks of
        an Englishman as the <strong lang="de">Engl&auml;nder</strong>; to change the sex, he adds
        <strong lang="de">inn</strong>, and that stands for Englishwoman -- <strong lang="de">Engl&auml;nderinn</strong>. That seems
        descriptive enough, but still it is not exact enough for a German; so he precedes the word with that article
        which indicates that
        the creature to follow is feminine, and writes it down thus: &quot;<strong lang="de">die</strong> Engl&auml;nder
        <strong lang="de">inn</strong>,&quot; -- which means &quot;the <strong lang="de">she-Englishwoman</strong>.&quot; I consider that
        that person is over-described.</p>

    <p>Well, after the student has learned the sex of a great number of nouns, he is still in a difficulty, because he
        finds it impossible to persuade his tongue to refer to things as &quot;<strong lang="de">he</strong>&quot; and
        &quot;<strong lang="de">she</strong>,&quot;
        and &quot;
        <strong lang="de">him</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong lang="de">her</strong>,&quot; which it has been always accustomed to refer to
        it as &quot;
        <strong lang="de">it</strong>.&quot; When he even frames a German sentence in his mind, with the hims and hers in the
        right places, and then works up his courage to the utterance-point, it is no use -- the moment he begins to
        speak his tongue flies
        the track and all those labored males and females come out as &quot;
        <strong lang="de">it</strong>s.&quot; And even when he is reading German to himself, he always calls those things
        &quot;<strong lang="de">it</strong>,&quot; where as he ought to read in this way:</p>
